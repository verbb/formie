### Fixed
- Fixed recipients field values not saving correctly.

### Removed
- Removed `columnWidth` from GraphQL queries (it did nothing).

## 1.4.13 - 2021-08-09
> {warning} Please read through the Breaking Changes before updating.

### Added
- Added `field.getHtmlDataId()` which replaces `field.getHtmlId()`.
- Added `data-fui-id` attribute to all inputs for default templates.
- Added `typeName` and `inputTypeName` to the FieldInterface for GQL queries.
- Added `prefixOptions` to Name field for GraphQL queries.
- Added `countryOptions` to Address field for GraphQL queries.
- Added `CsrfTokenInterface` to GraphQL `FormInterface` for easier fetching of CSRF details.

- Changed `Phone::getCountries` to `Phone::getCountryOptions`.
- Changed `Address::getCountries` to `Address::getCountryOptions`.

### Fixed
- Fixed an error when fetching a submission via its `uid`, not populating form attributes correctly.
- Fixed rendering the same form multiple times would lead non-unique labels. Causing issues for checkbox/radio/agree fields.
- Fixed rebuild project config not typecasting some settings correctly (therefore showing changes).
- Fixed multiple rows in table fields not saving correctly.
- Fixed multi-page, page reload forms with conditions not working correctly, when page or field conditions are based off previous page values. Ajax-based forms do not have this issue.

- Fixed GraphQL submission mutations not validating correctly.

### Breaking Changes
- If you rely on the `id` attribute of any `<input>` or `<select>` element on the front-end, these have been changed in order for them to be truly unique. For instance `fields-formie-form-formHandle-formField` now becomes `fields-formie-form-56526107b0a3e1eb3-formHandle-formField`. Please instead use the `data-fui-id` attribute for the old value if you need it.

## 1.3.3 - 2020-12-06
> {warning} If you are overriding templates for `field.html`, you **must** update your template to include `data-field-config="{{ field.getConfigJson(form) | json_encode | raw }}"`. This is the new and improved method for fields to define their config settings, picked up by JavaScript classes. Without making this change, field JS will not work. Refer to [this commit change](https://github.com/verbb/formie/commit/c5d5eda10b39063e1cf782b38f84bebe0da6fdf9#diff-ba26d5dbf9dcd3281c9b0b3c16f822eff1d2943c2134518d4ecea26d10907be4R90-R92).

### Added
- Added `defaultState` for GraphQL queries for Agree fields. This replaces `defaultValue`.
- Added `defaultDate` for GraphQL queries for Date fields. This replaces `defaultValue`.

- Added `getConfigJson()` for all fields to define settings for JS modules.

### Changed
- Formie now requires Craft 3.5+.
- Form queries via GraphQL are now no longer automatically included in the public schema.
- Submission queries via GraphQL are now no longer automatically included in the public schema.
- Submission mutations via GraphQL are now no longer automatically included in the public schema.
- When (soft) deleting a form, any submissions will also be (soft) deleted. These are also restored if the form is restored.
- Refactor JS behaviour for fields that require it. We now use a `data-field-config` attribute on the field to store JS module settings. This is then initialized once the JS has been lazy-loaded. This allows us to split configuration from initialization and may also help with custom JS.
- Renamed `Field::getFrontEndJsVariables()` to `Field::getFrontEndJsModules()`.
- Improve handling of multi-page non-ajax forms, where some fields required JS. Formie now detects what JS needs to be used for the current page for a page-reload form, or the entire form for an ajax form.
- Improve field JS to stop relying on IDs or classes to hook into field functionality. It now determines this through `data-field-config` attribute on the field wrapper element. This should allow for greater template flexibility.
- Submissions now make use of the same JS/CSS code that the front-end does.

### Fixed
- Fixed errors when garbage collection is called for sent notifications.
- Fixed when deleting a form, the submissions for that form weren't also deleted.
