# Mollie
Connect Mollie to take payments through the provider configured for your form. You need access to configure the form in Craft and credentials for the destination account. The steps below establish the connection; finish by sending a test submission to verify the result.

### Step 1. Create the Integration
1. Navigate to **Formie** → **Settings** → **Payments**.
1. Click the **New Integration** button.
1. Select **Mollie** as the **Integration Provider**.

### Step 2. Connect to the Mollie API
1. Go to the <a href="https://www.mollie.com/dashboard" target="_blank">Mollie Dashboard</a>.
1. Navigate to **Developers** → **API keys**.
1. Copy the **Live API key** and/or **Test API key**.
1. Paste the appropriate key into the **API Key** field in Formie.

### Step 3. Test Connection
1. Save this integration.
1. Click on the **Refresh** button in the right-hand sidebar.

### Step 4. Field Setting
1. Go to the form you want to enable this integration on.
1. Add a **Payment** field to your form.
1. Select Mollie for the **Payment Provider**.

The Mollie payment integration supports only once-off payments.

## Verify a Submission

Save the form, open it on your site and submit recognisable test values. Complete a test payment and inspect both the saved submission and the provider’s transaction record. Confirm the amount, currency and final payment state before enabling live payments.

If nothing arrives, check whether integration conditions matched, whether the submission was complete and non-spam, and whether Craft’s queue has processed the job. A successful connection check verifies credentials; it does not prove that field mapping and delivery work. See [Connect and Test an Integration](/integrations/connect-and-test-an-integration) for a complete mapping and verification workflow.
