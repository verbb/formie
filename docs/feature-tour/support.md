# Support
We offer several [support methods](docs:support/get-support) when it comes to getting help with Formie. However, you can use the in-built support form to send us a bunch of detail about your form, including fields and settings. This greatly improves changes of the support team replicating your issue if we have your same setup.

Navigate to **Formie** → **Settings** → **Get Support** and follow the instructions to fill out a support request.

We only collect the information that we require to troubleshoot a forms issue:
- Your Craft version
- Your Formie version and license
- Your Formie log file(s)
- Your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files
- Your form (selected below) settings, fields, and notifications
- Your custom form/email templates (if using any)

Any other content such as your content in entries, user data, orders, products, etc. is not sent to support.
